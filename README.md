# Agnost Server-Side Client Library

Javascript server-side client for Agnost backend app development platform. **Please note that this library can only be uset at the server side. You cannot use this library at your front-end clients.**

Agnost API servers automatically install this library by default and exposes the installed server-side client as `agnost` global variable. You can access all server-side methods through this `agnost` object. For this reason you do not need to install this library manually since it is already included in your API servers.
